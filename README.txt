
The reason why I included this was to demonstrate project management skills.
This is the block-programming project completed by the 5 middle schoolers I oversaw while with AppJam+.
I refused to code for them, and am quiet proud of that fact. We worked on it twice a week in hour and a half sessions about 8 weeks.

We used Thunkable.com's block-programming. The Aia file can be uploaded to Thunkable.com and used as the pseudo source code. The APK was tested on Android 7.0.
